### Assignment 2

Define the queue interface and implement it using an array. 
The queue would support methods to add an item to a queue, delete an item from the queue, check whether the queue is empty, check whether the queue is full. 
Address the issue related to queue getting full despite unused space in the array by providing circular implementation of the queue.
