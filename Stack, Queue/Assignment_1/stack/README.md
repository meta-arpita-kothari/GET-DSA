### Assignment 1

Define the stack interface and use it to implement the method for evaluating an infix integer arithmetic expression. 
The method will take the infix expression as a string and tokenize it to extract the integers and operators. 
You can assume the expression has only integer constants, and the tokens are separated using spaces. 
The expression will support variables, arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), relational operators (==, !=, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=), 
and boolean operators (&amp;&amp;, ||, !), and parentheses. You can assume that arithmetic operators will not be used in unary form. 
Use the Java rules for precedence and associativity of operators.
